This folder contains project files for Microsoft Visual C++.

To compile and run FLTK Dock with Microsoft Visual C++, you 
need to compile FLTK with RTTI (Run-Time Type Information) 
support for both Debug and Release build (avoid building 
"Release MinSize" although possible by ignoring "libcmt"). 
(FLTK Dock is configured to compile with RTTI.)

(An Easy way is to put both "fltkdock*" and "fltk*" directories 
in same level and rename "fltk-2.0*" to "fltk-2.0").


FOR BEGINNER

Select Enable Run-Time Type Information from C/C++ tab and 
category C++ Language of Project Settings Dialog. Ensure 
this for all configurations (at least for debug and release) 
and required project (or select all projects). Otherwise 
run-time error will occur though compilation is successful.
